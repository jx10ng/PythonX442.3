#Hello
My name is Sam. Iâ€™m from Irvine, California. 
I'm on an adventure to explore the world.
Will you join me?
We will be traveling to Springfield, Illinois to meet my great-grandmother. 
She is 101 years old. 
It will be her birthday on October 25th. 
We will also be just in time to see the circus in town.
It is a sight to be seen.
Fascinating as can be. 
There is a two-headed bear that does all kinds of tricks.
